## 1 Background

A tutorial is a step-by-step guide to a specific topic. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the topic, 
demonstrating the functionality and use cases. It is designed to be self-contained and easy to follow.
However, the purpose of a tutorial is to not only educate users on functionality but also provide inspiration for new 
approaches to solving problems.

This document provides specific guidelines for creating Jupyter Notebook tutorials focused on individual modules.

Unlike package-level tutorials, these module tutorials offer a more targeted approach, helping users understand the 
functionality, features, and use cases of specific modules. The guidelines cover how to define the audience and scope, 
structure the tutorial content, demonstrate module-specific functionality, show interactions with other modules, and 
present practical examples. By following these guidelines, developers can create focused, effective tutorials that help 
users leverage the full potential of individual modules within the larger package ecosystem.


## 2 Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebooks are a powerful tool for creating interactive tutorials. They allow users to combine text, code, and 
visualizations into a single document. They are ideal for educational purposes, as they provide a clear and concise 
explanation of a topic, demonstrating the functionality and use cases.

When creating a tutorial, it is important to consider an report the following:
- **Kernel Choice:** Specify if needed.
- **Magic Commands:** Explain any used.


## 3 Directory Hierarchy

Tutorials should be organized in a directory structure that mirrors the package structure. This makes it easy for users 
to find tutorials relevant to the specific components they're interested in.

- Each major package should have its own directory under the `tutorials/` directory
- Subpackages should have their own subdirectories when they contain multiple components
- Related tutorials should be grouped together in the same directory
- Filenames should start with descriptive name followed by `_tutorial` (e.g., `name_tutorial.py`).
- Use the format `<component_name>_tutorial.py` for individual component tutorials
- For tutorials that demonstrate multiple components working together, use a descriptive name that indicates the functionality being demonstrated, e.g., `caching_with_sentinel_tutorial.py`
- Use lowercase with underscores for file names (snake_case)

Example:
```
tutorials/
  bases/                          # Tutorials for the bases package
    collections/                  # Tutorials for the bases.collections subpackage
      basedict_tutorial.py
    basecallable_tutorial.py
    sentinelobject_tutorial.py
  ...
  cachingtools/                 # Tutorials for the cachingtools package
    caches/                     # Tutorials for the cachingtools.caches subpackage
    cachingobject_tutorial.py
    ...
```


## 4 Module Tutorial Notebook Structure

Tutorial files should follow a consistent naming convention to make them easily identifiable:

- Use the format `<component_name>_tutorial.py` for individual module tutorials.
- Use lowercase with underscores for file names (snake_case)
- Avoid generic names like `tutorial.py` or `demo.py`

In a tutorial, a clear and logical flow is essential. These sections are recommended:

1. Title and Introduction
2. Core Functionality
3. Module Interactions
4. Advanced Features
5. Examples
6. API Highlights
7. Troubleshooting / FAQs

dependencies or setup requirements. These examples should be complete, runnable units of code that demonstrate specific
functionality while being independent of external resources. This approach makes the tutorial more accessible and
reduces potential points of failure.

- Avoid reliance on external files or services if possible. If necessary, provide clear instructions on how to 
  obtain/set them up, or include mock data/objects directly in the notebook.
- For data, consider including a small CSV or generating data programmatically.
- If there are unit tests, use them as a reference but do not copy them exactly. The tutorial and examples should 
  educate the user on how to use key aspects of the module and how they can use it to create new programs, not just 
  test it.  


### 5.7 Error Handling Examples

The Error Handling Examples section demonstrates how to handle common errors and exceptions that users might encounter
while working with the module. This section helps users understand potential pitfalls and how to gracefully handle
error conditions, making their code more robust and maintainable. It is optional, but recommended.

- Use `##` for major sections (H2).
- Use `###` for sub-sections (H3), and so on.
- Be consistent with heading levels.


### 6.2 Code Blocks

- In Markdown cells, use backticks for inline code: `my_function()`.
- Use triple backticks for code blocks:
    ```python
    # Python code goes here
    ```
- Specify the language for syntax highlighting in Markdown code blocks (e.g., ` ```python`).


### 6.3 Emphasis

- Use `**bold**` for strong emphasis (e.g., key terms, warnings).
- Use `*italics*` for mild emphasis or for terms being defined.


### 6.4 Lists

- Use numbered lists for sequential steps.
- Use bulleted lists for non-sequential items or features.


### 6.5 Links

- Use descriptive text for hyperlinks:
    - Good: `[Read the full API documentation](link-to-docs)`
    - Avoid: `Click [here](link-to-docs)`

  
## 7 Tips for Module Tutorial Effectiveness

This section provides practical recommendations for creating impactful and successful module tutorials. These tips help
ensure the tutorial achieves its educational goals while maintaining user engagement.
