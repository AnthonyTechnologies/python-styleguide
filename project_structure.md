## 1 Background

This document describes an opinionated, practical structure for Python projects used in this repository and intended to
be reusable for most Python packages. The original structure was inspired by ["Hypermodern Python"](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/)
by [Claudio Jolowicz](https://github.com/cjolowicz).

A consistent structure improves:
- Discoverability: developers can quickly find code, tests, docs, and examples.
- Maintainability: changes affect a single, well‑defined place.
- Tooling integration: common tools (pytest, nox, pre-commit, type checkers, doc builders) work with little or no extra configuration.


## 2 Project Overview

At a high level, a Python project is split into:
- Configurations that define behavior of the project and its tools.
- Source code (installable package under src/).
- Tests that mirror source code.
- Documentation (narrative guides, API references, and style guides).
- Examples that demonstrate typical usage.
- Tutorials for step-by-step learning paths.

This separation keeps responsibilities clear and enables parallel development across these areas.


## 3 Project Root Structure

A typical repository root resembles the following:

```
project_root/
├── .github                 # GitHub workflow configurations
├── docs/                   # Project documentation (incl. python-styleguide)
├── examples/               # Runnable usage examples mirroring src/ API areas
├── src/                    # Source code (installable packages live here)
├── tests/                  # Test suite mirroring src/ (unit, integration, perf)
├── tutorials/              # In‑depth, step‑by‑step guides
├── .codecov.yml            # Code coverage configuration
├── .editorconfig           # General config for code editors
├── .gitignore              # Specifies which files Git should ignore
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml # Pre-commit hook configurations
├── CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst     # Community standards
├── CONTRIBUTING.rst        # How to contribute
├── LICENSE.rst             # License
├── noxfile.py              # Automation for tests, linting, docs, etc.
├── poetry.lock             # Dependency lockfile (Poetry)
├── pyproject.toml          # Config for the project and build/tooling
└── README.rst              # Project overview (reStructuredText)
```

### 3.1 Configurations

Configuration files define how the project is built, tested, documented, formatted, and released. Keep these files at
the repository root so tools can auto-discover them.

Related guidelines:
- Project Tooling — see [project_tools.md](project_tools.md) for how pre-commit, nox, and other tools are configured and used in this repository.

#### 3.1.1 Python Project Config

Primary, language- and build-related configuration:
- pyproject.toml — Canonical project configuration per PEP 517/518 (build-system, metadata, tool configs).
- poetry.lock — Dependency lock file when using Poetry for dependency management.
- setup.cfg/setup.py — Only if legacy build backends are required.

Recommended conventions:
- Centralize tool configurations (ruff/flake8, black, isort, pytest, coverage, mypy, sphinx) inside pyproject.toml when supported.
- Treat pyproject.toml as the source of truth for package metadata.
- Keep versioning unified (prefer single-source versioning via package __init__ or Poetry’s version field).
- When using Poetry, it’s acceptable to expose metadata via the PEP 621 [project] table and set dynamic fields (e.g., version, readme) that are sourced from [tool.poetry]. Document this clearly in your README/CONTRIBUTING to avoid confusion.

#### 3.1.2 Development Tools

Operational/configuration files for development workflows:
- .pre-commit-config.yaml — Pre-commit hooks for formatting, linting, and sanity checks.
- noxfile.py — Automated sessions for tests, linting, type checks, building docs, releasing.
- codecov.yml or .codecov.yml — Code coverage reporting configuration.
- .editorconfig — Uniform editor behavior.
- .gitignore — Ignore patterns for VCS.
- conftest.py — Shared pytest fixtures (typically resides in tests/ but configures test behavior project-wide).

Good practices:
- Ensure CI runs nox sessions to keep local and CI workflows aligned.
- Make pre-commit mandatory in contributor docs.

### 3.2 Source Code

The src/ layout prevents accidental imports from the project root and mirrors how the package will be installed from a wheel/SDist.

Related guidelines:
- Code and File Layout — see [code_file_layout.md](code_file_layout.md) for file structure, headers, imports, and definitions layout.
- Syntactic Guidelines — see [syntax.md](syntax.md) for naming, docstrings, comments, and formatting rules.
- Semantics Guidelines — see [semantics.md](semantics.md) for code organization principles and design guidance.

Structure:
```
src/
└── your_package/
    ├── module1/
    ├── module2/
    ├── module3/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── py.typed         # Present if you ship typing information
```

Guidelines:
- Organize by domain: each top-level subpackage focuses on a clear concern (e.g., bases, collections, functions, operations for baseobjects).
- Keep public API explicit via __all__ or documented imports in __init__.py.
- Consider private implementation modules prefixed with _ when appropriate.

### 3.3 Tests

Tests should mirror the source structure to make navigation intuitive.

Related guidelines:
- Unit Tests — see [unit_tests.md](unit_tests.md) for conventions on structure, naming, fixtures, and assertions.
- Performance Tests — see [performance_tests.md](performance_tests.md) for organizing and executing performance-focused tests.

Structure:
```
tests/
├── module1/
├── module2/
├── module3/
├── .ruff_tests.toml
└── __init__.py
```

Recommendations:
- Separate performance tests when applicable:
  ```
  tests/
  └── module1/
      ├── performance/
      └── functional_test.py
  ```
- Include unit, integration, and property-based tests where they add value.
- Prefer descriptive test names and arrange-act-assert structure.

Linting:
- This directory uses a local Ruff configuration at tests/.ruff_tests.toml to tailor linting rules for tests. It
extends/overrides root pyproject [tool.ruff] settings for files under tests/.

### 3.4 Documentation

Documentation consolidates user and developer knowledge.

Related guidelines:
- Documentation — see [documentation.md](documentation.md) for guidelines on writing, organizing, and maintaining
  documentation, including docstrings, user guides, and API references.
- Project Tooling — see [project_tools.md](project_tools.md) for how documentation is built and served via nox (docs and docs-build sessions) and where Sphinx is configured.

Common layout:
```
docs/
├── api/                  # API documentation (generated)
├── guides/               # User/developer guides
├── notes/                # Development notes / design docs
└── python-styleguide/    # Style guidelines for this repo
```

Guidelines:
- Author in a format supported by your doc toolchain (e.g., Sphinx/reStructuredText, MkDocs/Markdown).
- Keep API docs generated from code docstrings where possible.
- Cross-link examples and tutorials to relevant guides.

### 3.5 Examples

Examples demonstrate common usage scenarios and should mirror the src/ structure:

Related guidelines:
- Examples — see [examples.md](examples.md) for structure, formatting, narrative style, and expectations for runnable snippets.
```
examples/
├── module1/
├── module2/
├── module3/
├── .ruff_examples.toml
└── __init__.py
```

Guidelines:
- Each example should be a runnable, minimal script focused on one concept.
- Include comments and expected outputs when helpful.

Linting:
- This directory uses a local Ruff configuration at examples/.ruff_examples.toml to tailor linting rules for example code. It extends/overrides root pyproject [tool.ruff] settings for files under examples/.

### 3.6 Tutorials

Tutorials provide step-by-step learning paths and deeper explorations.

Related guidelines:
- Module Tutorials — see [module_tutorials.md](module_tutorials.md) for how to design, structure, and validate tutorials focused on a single module.
- Package Tutorials — see [package_tutorials.md](package_tutorials.md) for end-to-end package tutorials, including structure, scope, and documentation tips.

Suggested layout:
```
tutorials/
├── getting_started/
├── advanced_usage/
├── specific_features/
└── .ruff_tutorials.toml
```

Guidelines:
- Build progressively: start from basics and layer complexity.
- Include prerequisites, goals, time estimates, and validation steps.

Linting:
- This directory uses a local Ruff configuration at tutorials/.ruff_tutorials.toml to tailor linting rules for tutorial content. It extends/overrides root pyproject [tool.ruff] settings for files under tutorials/.

## 4 Implementation Guidelines

### 4.1 Applying Generically

To apply this structure to a new or existing project:

Related guidelines:
- Syntactic Guidelines — see [syntax.md](syntax.md) for code-level conventions you’ll apply when creating modules and packages.
- Semantics Guidelines — see [semantics.md](semantics.md) for organizing code by responsibility and maintaining cohesion.
- Project Tooling — see [project_tools.md](project_tools.md) for automating checks and workflows via pre-commit and nox.

1. Create foundational directories:
   - src/, tests/, docs/, examples/, tutorials/ (as needed)
   - Add root configuration files.
2. Identify logical domains:
   - Split source into coherent subpackages per domain.
   - Avoid “misc” or overly broad modules.
3. Mirror structure across artifacts:
   - Align tests and examples with src/ modules.
4. Automate common flows:
   - Use nox to standardize test, lint, type-check, build, docs sessions.
   - Wire pre-commit to run formatters/linters locally.
5. Document:
   - Provide README, contribution guide, and usage docs.
   - Maintain a changelog and API docs for public packages.

### 4.2 Best Practices

1. Keep modules focused and cohesive.
2. Maintain parallel structure for code, tests, and examples.
3. Use descriptive, consistent naming.
4. Separate implementation details with private modules (prefix with _).
5. Provide typing information (py.typed) and type hints.
6. Document public APIs with docstrings; generate API docs.
7. Include unit, integration, and, where helpful, performance tests.
8. Prefer automation (nox, pre-commit) to enforce consistency.

By following these guidelines, you’ll create a Python project that is easy to navigate, test, and maintain.
